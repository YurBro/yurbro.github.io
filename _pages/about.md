PhD Researcher|Formulation Optimization|AI| Automation

I am a PhD researcher at the **University of Surrey**, specializing in **skin product formulation optimization**. My research focuses on **leveraging automated platforms and intelligent optimization methods** to accelerate formulation design. By integrating **automated formulation systems, machine learning models, and multi-objective optimization**, I aim to improve formulation efficiency, reduce experimental costs, and enhance personalized formulation development.

Research Highlights:
  路 Early Decision-Making Algorithm (EDMA): Optimizes formulation selection based on experimental data to reduce the number of required tests.
  路 IVPT/IVRT for Skin Absorption Testing: Enhances drug permeation prediction and validation.
  路 Automated Experimental Scheduling Optimization: Uses genetic algorithms (GA) to optimize resource allocation in robotic formulation systems.
  路 Machine Learning for Formulation Prediction: Investigating Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Neural Networks for data-driven formulation optimization.
